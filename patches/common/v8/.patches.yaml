    Patches that node applies to v8.
    Generated with

      $ cd third_party/electron_node
      $ CURRENT_NODE_VERSION=vX.Y.Z
      # Find the last commit with the message "deps: update V8 to <some version>"
      # This commit corresponds to node resetting V8 to its pristine upstream
      # state at the stated version.
      $ LAST_V8_UPDATE="$(git log --grep='^deps: update V8' --format='%H' -1 deps/v8)"
      # This creates a patch file containing all changes in deps/v8 from
      # $LAST_V8_UPDATE up to the current node version, formatted in a way that
      # it will apply cleanly to the V8 repository (i.e. with `deps/v8`
      # stripped off the path and excluding the v8/gypfiles directory, which
      # isn't present in V8.

  file: add_realloc.patch
  description: |
    Blink overrides ArrayBuffer's allocator with its own one, while Node simply
    uses malloc and free, so we need to use v8's allocator in Node. As part of the
    10.6.0 upgrade, we needed to make SerializerDelegate accept an allocator
    argument in its constructor, and override ReallocateBufferMemory and
    FreeBufferMemory to use the allocator. We cannot simply allocate and then memcpy
    when we override ReallocateBufferMemory, so we therefore need to implement
    Realloc on the v8 side.
